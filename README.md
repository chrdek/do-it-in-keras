# Do it in Keras!

### Modern deep learning architectures and tasks, all implemented in Keras.

Have you ever scrolled through reddit, journal posts, deep learning forums or 5 year-old blogs trying to find an example for a task that you want to do?

Is your code not working, even after copy-pasting it from the main source?

Does your example code not include an example on your custom dataset?

Well, not anymore! Do it in Keras includes a lot of famous deep learning techniques in the format of Jupyter Notebooks, all done in the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library.

All of these architectures are organized in folders, named with the task they represent. Also, they include a folder with tasks for most of the architectures used.

### Motivation

Most of the time I try to implement a new architecture, I have to scroll through a lot of blogs, books and courses trying to understand what's going on in the code. 
Also, a lot of these tutorials don't specify the library used, or how to use the architecture on custom datasets.

### Main libraries used

- The High level deep learning library [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks
